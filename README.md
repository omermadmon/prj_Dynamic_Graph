# prj_Dynamic_Graph

Data Structures and Algorithms course - programming assignment.
<br>
Dynamic Graph supports the following operations:
* Create empty graph - <i>O(1)</i>
* Insert / delete Node - <i>O(1)</i>
* Insert / delete Edge - <i>O(1)</i>
* Destroy Graph - <i>O(n+m)</i>
* Get node key / in degree / out degree - <i>O(1)</i>
* Run SCC (find strongly connected components) - <i>O(n+m)</i>
* Run BFS (breadth-first search) - <i>O(n+m)</i>

Where n - # nodes, m - # edges

## Getting Started (for Linux)

```
git clone https://github.com/omermadmon/prj_Dynamic_Graph.git
cd prj_Dynamic_Graph
g++ *.cpp
./a.out
```

Generate a dynamic graph and run tests using the methods mentioned above.
