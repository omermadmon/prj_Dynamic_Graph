# prj_Dynamic_Graph

Data Structures and Algorithms course - programming assignment.
<br>
Dynamic Graph supports the following operations:
* Create empty graph - O(1)
* Insert / delete Node - O(1)
* Insert / delete Edge - O(1)
* Destroy Graph - O(n+m)
* Get node key / in degree / out degree - O(1)
* Run SCC (find strongly connected components) - O(n+m)
* Run BFS (breadth-first search) - O(n+m)

Where n - # nodes, m - # edges
